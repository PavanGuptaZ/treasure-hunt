Treasure Hunt, an interactive web-based game developed to demonstrate drag-and-drop functionality using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This game provides a fun and engaging way to test your luck and strategic thinking. Two players alternate roles between a hider and a seeker in a suspenseful quest to find hidden treasures amidst dangers.

## About Project
I created Treasure Hunt during my journey learning web development to better understand and implement fundamental web technologies. This project served as a hands-on approach to mastering HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with a particular focus on enhancing my skills in handling various event listeners such as **dragstart**, **dragend**, **dragover**, **dragenter**, **dragleave**, and **drop**.

## Game Rules
Treasure Hunt is played with the following rules:
- The game board consists of 12 boxes.
- Each round, one player takes on the role of the hider and the other as the seeker.

- The hider places a gold object and a bomb in two separate boxes of their choice.

- The seeker then attempts to find the gold within three tries:

- If the seeker finds the gold, they win.
- If the seeker picks the box with the bomb, they lose immediately.
- If the seeker fails to find the gold after three attempts, they also lose.
